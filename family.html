	<h2> MY HAPPY FAMILY </h2>
	</section>


	<p>A happy family is a family who stays respectfully close & playful, chooses laughter daily and doesn’t sweat the small stuff; they express forgiveness soon, speak kindly about and to each other, and support each other’s big & small moments. They have learned to be better listeners and to admit when we are wrong as quickly as possible, while honoring their own boundaries and needs. A happy family ebbs and flows with life, keeps commitments, seeks balance & integrity, and chooses loving and productive habits. They are loyal to each other & remember that serving others is a high priority.</p>

	<p>This is my little family who are the people I love the most. I have only two siblings,I am the eldest child and my younger brother is named Firdaus who is 17 years old. My father is named Supardi which is 52 years old and my mother is named Norizam also 52 years old.</p>
