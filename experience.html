	<p align="justify"> Among the experiences that I was able to share was just after finishing SPM, while waiting for the exam results for a few months so I spent my time doing business online. A lot of experience I gained after starting this business. I decided to become an agent under named Cookies Celup Lelicious Cookies Celup Lelicous is one of the brands of homemade chocolate coated cookies. . I sell it on Instagram and also Whatsapp to attract customers. I got the items myself from the owner of the cookies, with the beginning as an agent, I took 15 bottles of cookies. I do provide home delivery and postage services but many of these customers are close to my home and I just need to make delivery to their homes. From my small business, I gained an increased level of confidence to promote and talk to customers who bought my products. So I will interact more with them so that they feel more comfortable and confident to buy more cookies that I sell after this. Before this, I was also a shy person when I wanted to talk to unknown people, but my confidence level was high to meet other people. This is one of the benefits when I start a business because I have to get rid of embarrassment when I want to be a seller. Before this, I wanted to do business only temporarily, but due to my sales being quite good, I continued the business before I entered UiTM. So my business ended up that far only because at that time I intended to focus on my studies only. But if there is another chance after this, I will return to business. So that was one of my experiences as an online trader just after finishing school which was quite interesting for me and to some extent gave me the opportunity 
	to learn and become a trader.</p>

<p align="justify">Apart from that, I also have experience during my study time at UiTM Machang where I became a commander under the co -curriculum of the Brassband uniformed body. I gained a lot of experience while being a commander which was very disciplining for me. Not only that, I also made many new acquaintances and friends. Under the Brassband organization, it will teach us to play various musical instruments. So it was a very meaningful experience when being a Brassband commander.</p>
